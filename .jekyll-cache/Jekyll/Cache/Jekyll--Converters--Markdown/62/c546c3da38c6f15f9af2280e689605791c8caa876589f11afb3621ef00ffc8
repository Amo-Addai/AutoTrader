I"þ<p>Consider you want to develop and test a strategy using Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD), a popular trend-following momentum indicator. 
In your strategy, you go long (buy) when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, and go short when the oppposite happens. After doing some
research, you discover that MACD signals are strongest when cross-ups occur below the histogram-zero line (for long entries), or when cross-downs 
occur above the histogram-zero line. Furthermore, you follow the adage that â€˜the trend is your friendâ€™, so only go long when price is above the 
200 exponential moving average, and short when price is below it.</p>

<p>Coding this up in AutoTrader is easy; all you need is a <a href="docs/strategies">strategy</a> file and a <a href="docs/config-files">config</a> file. Then, with a
one line command, you can backtest your strategy over any time period and any time frame.</p>

<p>The command to do this is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./AutoTrader -c macd -b -p -v 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the executable here is <em>AutoTrader</em>, to which you passed four flags:</p>
<ul>
  <li>-c: this flag is used to specify the strategy <a href="/docs/config-files">config</a> file</li>
  <li>-b: this flag tells AutoTrader to run in backtest mode</li>
  <li>-p: this flag tells AutoTrader to plot the results of the backtest onto an interactive chart</li>
  <li>-v: this flag sets the verbosity of the code - a value of 1 requests moderate verbosity.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a verbosity of 1, you will see an output similar to that shown below. As you can see, there is a detailed breakdown of traders taken during 
the backtest period.</p>

<p>The plot will look something like the one shown below. Note that the one here is just a static image, but you 
will be given an interactive chart when running AutoTrader. Click <a href="/docs/interactive-charts">here</a> to see the 
interactive version of the chart (which isnâ€™t quite ready to be viewed on mobile devices)!</p>

<p><img src="another-test/assets/images/backtest-example-plot.jpg" alt="backtest-demo-plot" /></p>

<p>Looks pretty good right? Well good news! Going from backtesting to live-trading is as easy as removing 
the â€˜-bâ€™ flag from the command above!</p>
