## Utility Functions

Refer to the [Virtual Broker Utility Functions](virtual-utils) for more information.






In backtesting, spread defines the average spread between ask and bid prices. Since historical data gives mid data (mid point between ask and bid), the orders will take the spread into account to adjust market orders. Example, if placing a buy market order, the order will be filled at:
Fill price = data_open + 0.5x spread
For placing a sell market order:
Fill price = data_open â€“ 0.5x spread
Of course, this will not be favourable to the trade, but it is more realistic. 

Commission are taken as a percentage of the trade. 
Commission: 0.005 = 0.005% cost per trade (both opening and closing)
-	eg: $100,000 position costs 0.005% * $100,000 = $5 to open, and another $5 to close.
