`AutoTrader/config/GLOBAL.yaml`

The global configuration file is read by AutoTrader when runnning the code. Depending on your strategy config file, some 
of the contents in the global configuration may be ignored. Nonetheless, you may specify all your account details in this 
file once when getting started, and easily switch between brokers when required by specifying them in the strategy configuration
file.

If you would like to recieve [email notifactions](emailing), you will need to set up a host email account to send emails from. The 
details of this host account are stored in the global config file under the 'HOST_ACCOUNT' field, as shown below. Next, you can
provide a mailing list of people to send emails to. You can also provide a mailing list in the strategy config file, in case you
would like a different mailing list for different strategies.
