Before building a strategy in AutoTrader, it is important to understand the structure of a project. If you are 
running AutoTrader as a package (that is, you installed it via `pip`), then you must set up your working directory
according to the structure below. Namely, you must have a `config/` directory - containing your 
[global](../docs/configuration-global) and [strategy](../docs/configuration-strategy) 
configuration files - and a `strategies/` directory - containing your [strategy files](../docs/strategies). 
Have a look at the docs for a bit more information on the structure of [AutoTrader](../docs/autotrader).
```
your_trading_project/
  |- config/
  |    |- GLOBAL.yaml
  |    |- your_strategy_config.yaml
  |- strategies/
  |    |- your_strategy.py
  |- run_script.py
```

Strategies in AutoTrader are built as classes, instantiated with strategy parameters, price data and the instrument
being traded. The `params` dict is read in from the strategy configuration file and contains all strategy-specific
parameters. This class must contain the `__init__` function and a method called `generate_signal`, as shown below.

```python
class ClassName():
    def __init__(self, params, data, instrument):
        ...
    def generate_signal(self, i, current_position):
        ...
```


All indicators used in the strategy are defined when the strategy is instantiated. For the EMA crossover strategy,
this will look as shown below.

```python
def __init__(self, params, data, instrument):
    ''' Define all indicators used in the strategy '''
    self.name   = "Strategy name"
    self.data   = data
    self.params = params
    
    # EMA's
    self.slow_ema = talib.EMA(self.data.Close.values, 
                              self.params['slow_ema'])
    
    self.fast_ema = talib.EMA(self.data.Close.values, 
                              self.params['fast_ema'])
    
    self.crossovers = crossover(self.fast_ema, 
                                self.slow_ema)
    
    # Construct indicators dict for plotting
    self.indicators = {'Fast EMA': {'type': 'EMA',
                                    'data': self.fast_ema},
                        'Slow EMA': {'type': 'EMA',
                                    'data': self.slow_ema}
                        }
    
    # Price swings
    self.swings         = indicators.find_swings(data)
    
    # Path variables
    strat_dir       = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    self.home_dir   = os.path.join(strat_dir, '..')
```







The next step is to define the signal generation function, `generate_signal`. This is where the logic of
the strategy goes.

```python
def generate_signal(self, i, current_position):
    ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''
    order_type      = 'market'
    related_orders  = None
    signal_dict     = {}
    
    # Put entry strategy here
    signal      = 0
    if len(current_position) == 0:
        # Not currently in any position, okay to enter long
        if self.crossovers[i] == 1:
            # Fast EMA has crossed above slow EMA, enter long
            signal = 1
    else:
        # Already in a position, only look for long exits
        if self.crossovers[i] == -1:
            signal = -1
            related_orders = list(current_position.keys())[0]
            order_type = 'close'
    
    # Calculate exit targets
    exit_dict = self.generate_exit_levels(signal, i)
    
    # Construct signal dictionary
    signal_dict["order_type"]   = order_type
    signal_dict["direction"]    = signal
    signal_dict["stop_loss"]    = exit_dict["stop_loss"]
    signal_dict["stop_type"]    = exit_dict["stop_type"]
    signal_dict["take_profit"]  = exit_dict["take_profit"]
    signal_dict["related_orders"] = related_orders
    
    return signal_dict
```


It is often useful to include a separate function for generating 

```python
def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
    ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''

    # Put exit strategy here
    stop = np.nan
    take = np.nan
    stop_type = 'limit'
    
    exit_dict = {'stop_loss'    : stop, 
                  'stop_type'    : stop_type,
                  'take_profit'  : take}
    
    return exit_dict
```


Assuming that you have already set up the [global configuration](../docs/configuration-global), the next step is to 
build your [strategy configuration](../docs/configuration-strategy) file.
