title: Getting Price Data
permalink: tutorials/price-data

AuotTrader is compatible with all kinds of price data, regardless of the instrument being traded. This means that
it can be used for stocks, cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, futures, options, commodities and even Mars 
bars - provided that you can get price data for them.
Luckily for you, AutoTrader is capable of retrieving price data for [supported instruments](../docs/brokers) automatically 
using the utility function [AutoData](../docs/autodata). All you have to do is provide a few details in the 
[configuration files](../docs/configuration) and AutoTrader will take care of the rest.

If you would prefer to provide your own price data, you can simply pass the filename to AutoTrader using the `--data` (`-d` 
for short) flag.






## Using AutoData





For detailed documenation of *AutoData*, refer to the [docs](../docs/autodata).




## Providing your own data



```bash
$ ./AutoTrader.py -b -c simple_macd -d price_data.csv
```
