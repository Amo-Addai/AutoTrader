Welcome to the AutoTrader Documentation. Everything you need to know about the code is documented here.

## Code Workflow
The schematic below provides an overview of the workflow employed by AutoTrader. Briefly, there are two input files
used to control the behaviour of the code: the [global configuration](configuration-global) file and the 
[strategy configuration](configuration-strategy) file, both highlighted in blue. The global configuration file is 
stored locally on your computer and contains your personal information required for automated trading, such as your 
brokerage account details, and your email account, if you wish to recieve [email notifications](emailing)
of trade activity.

Information from the global configuration file is passed into the [environment manager](environment-manager), which 
returns the appropriate broker configuration details. This, along with an instrument watchlist from the strategy
configuration file, is passed into the [data retrieval](autodata) system to fetch price data.

Price data is then passed into the [strategy](strategies) module with strategy parameters, which will initiate the 
strategy by pre-loading any indicators used. The main code, [autotrader.py](autotrader), will then iterate over the
data as appropriate and recieve trade signals from the strategy module. If running in [backtest mode](autotrader#backtest-mode), 
trade orders will be submitted to the [virtual broker](brokers-virtual). If running in [live-trade](autotrader#livetrade-mode), 
only the very latest signal (corresponding to current market conditions) will be used and submitted to the appropriate
[broker](brokers) API.

When [autotrader.py](autotrader) has finished running its core processes, the relevant data will be passed on for 
post-processing. This includes, but is not limited to, visualisation of results, emailing order details, and logging
information where appropriate.
