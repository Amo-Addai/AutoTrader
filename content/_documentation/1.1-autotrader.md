## User Options

The user options will be displayed by default when calling AutoTrader with no input arguments. Doing so will display the usage
instructions show below, via the `print_usage` method.

AutoTrader is an algorithmic trading development platform.

It has three run modes:
  1. Backtest mode
  2. Livetrade mode
  3. Scan mode
By default, AutoTrader will run in livetrade mode.

The user options are shown below.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flag                                 Comment [short flag]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required:
  --config <path>                    path to config file [-c]

Optional: 
  --help                             show help for usage [-h]
  --verbosity <int>                  set verbosity (0,1,2) [-v]
  --backtest                         run in backtesting mode [-b]
  --plot                             plot results of backtest [-p]
  --notify <int>                     notify by email when ordering [-n]
  --log                              log backtest results to file [-l]
  --analyse                          run correlation study of indicators [-a]
  --scan                             run in scan mode only [-s]
  --optimise                         optimise strategy parameters [-o]
  --instruments                      specify specific instruments [-i]
  --data                             load custom price data file [-d]

For more information, try using -h <Option>. For example, use 
 -h backtest or -h b for more information on the backtesting flag.
```

As shown in the output above, help on specific user options can be obtained by using the `--help` or `-h` flag, followed 
by the specific user option. See the [Getting Help](../tutorials/help) tutorial guide for an example.

### Required Inputs
A [strategy configuration](configuration-strategy) file is always required to run AutoTrader, as it dictates the technical
analysis to be performed on the price data. All other user options are optional, however they will control how AutoTrader 
runs. This is discussed below in the [Modes of Operation](#modes-of-operation).



# Modes of Operation
AutoTrader has three modes of operation:
  1. Backtest mode
  2. Livetrade mode
  3. Scan mode

By default, AutoTrader will run in livetrade mode. That is, when `self.backtest` and `self.scan` are set to `False`, AutoTrader
will assume live-trading mode.


## Backtest Mode
Backtest mode is activated by setting the attribute `self.backtest` to `True`. When true, AutoTrader will use the dates
specified in the [strategy configuration](configuration-strategy) file to retrieve historical price data from 
[autodata.py](autodata). 

### Verbosity
The verbosity of the code is set by the `verbosity` attribute. In backtest mode,


### Show Plot

### Data Indexing
Although data and strategy indicators are pre-loaded when a strategy is instantiated, the platform is event-driven thanks to the 
indexing system employed. This system involves iterating through the entire dataset, candlestick by candlestick. Upon each iteration,
the method `generate_signal` from the strategy module is called to obtain a signal corresponding to the current timestep. 



## Livetrade Mode
If both `backtesting` and `scan` attributes are set to `False`, AutoTrader will run in livetrade mode. 

In livetrade mode, the data indexing is similar to that described [above](#data-indexing) in backtest mode, however, only the last 
candle is indexed. This candle corresponds to latest market conditions, so long as the data retrieval was called upon runnning 
AutoTrader, to retrieve the last `N` candles. This parameter is specified as the `period` in the 
[strategy configuration](configuration-strategy) file.


### Email Notifications
Email notifications 

|  `notify` value | Behaviour                                                   |
| :-------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0        | No emails will be sent.                                     |
|        1        | Daily order summaries will be sent.                         |
|        2        | Email notifications of every trade taken will be sent.      |




## Scan mode
The third mode of AutoTrader is scan mode, activated by setting the `scan` attribute to `True`. When activated, AutoTrader will run
as in livetrade mode, but instead of submitting an order to the broker when a signal is received, it will notify you that the scan 
criteria has been met. If email notifications are not activated (using the `notify` flag), the scan results will be printed to the 
console. 


### Market Scan Notifications
Email notifications require a host email account and a mailing list specified in the [global](configuration-global) and 
[strategy](configuration-strategy) files as appropriate. The extent of these notifications is controlled by the `notify`
attribute of AutoTrader in a similar way to the verbosity of the code.

|  `notify` value | Behaviour                                                   |
| :-------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0        | No emails will be sent.                                     |
|        1        |                          |
|        2        |    |
