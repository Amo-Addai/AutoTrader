## User Options

The user options will be displayed by default when calling AutoTrader with no input arguments. Doing so will display the usage
instructions show below, via the `print_usage` method.

AutoTrader is an algorithmic trading development platform.

It has three run modes:
  1. Backtest mode
  2. Livetrade mode
  3. Scan mode
By default, AutoTrader will run in livetrade mode.

The user options are shown below.

```

As shown in the output above, help on specific user options can be obtained by using the `--help` or `-h` flag, followed 
by the specific user option. See the [Getting Help](../tutorials/help) tutorial guide for an example.

### Required Inputs
A [strategy configuration](configuration-strategy) file is always required to run AutoTrader, as it dictates the technical
analysis to be performed on the price data. All other user options are optional, however they will control how AutoTrader 
runs. This is discussed below in the [Modes of Operation](#modes-of-operation).



# Modes of Operation
AutoTrader has three modes of operation:
  1. Backtest mode
  2. Livetrade mode
  3. Scan mode

By default, AutoTrader will run in livetrade mode. That is, when `self.backtest` and `self.scan` are set to `False`, AutoTrader
will assume live-trading mode.


## Backtest Mode
Backtest mode is activated by setting the attribute `self.backtest` to `True`. When true, AutoTrader will use the dates
specified in the [strategy configuration](configuration-strategy) file to retrieve historical price data from 
[autodata.py](autodata). Next, the strategy will be initiated, pre-loading all indicators. Finally, AutoTrader will iterate 
over the data and retrieve the signals from the strategy. Useful flags are notes for backtest mode are provided below.

### Verbosity
The verbosity of the code is set by the `verbosity` attribute. In backtest mode, the values given to `verbosity` result in the 
following behaviour.

|  `verbosity` value | Behaviour                                                   |
| :----------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|         0          | All outputs are suppressed.                                 |
|         1          | Minimal output is displayed (test period, trade statistics) |
|         2          | All possible output are displayed.                          |


### Show Plot
When the `show_plot` attribute is set to `True`, AutoTrader will pass a trade summary dictionary to `autoplot.py`. This dictionary
will then be used to plot the trade history on a price chart, along with key indicators used in the strategy. Read more about 
AutoPlot [here](autoplot).


### Data Indexing
Although data and strategy indicators are pre-loaded when a strategy is instantiated, the platform is event-driven thanks to the 
indexing system employed. This system involves iterating through the entire dataset, candlestick by candlestick. Upon each iteration,
the method `generate_signal` from the strategy module is called to obtain a signal corresponding to the current timestep. 




## Livetrade Mode
If both `backtesting` and `scan` attributes are set to `False`, AutoTrader will run in livetrade mode. 

In livetrade mode, the data indexing is similar to that described [above](#data-indexing) in backtest mode, however, only the last 
candle is indexed. This candle corresponds to latest market conditions, so long as the data retrieval was called upon runnning 
AutoTrader, to retrieve the last `N` candles. This parameter is specified as the `period` in the 
[strategy configuration](configuration-strategy) file.


### Email Notifications
Email notifications 

|  `notify` value | Behaviour                                                   |
| :-------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0        | No emails will be sent.                                     |
|        1        | Minimal emails will be sent (summaries only).               |
|        2        | All possible emails will be sent (every order and summary). |

Note that if daily email summaries are desired, `email_manager.py` must be employed in a scheduled job to send the summary.
This is to allow for flexibility in when the daily summaries will be sent. Setting the `notify` flag to `1` or greater will
therefore write to a text file containing all orders placed since the last email summary. See more information [here](emailing).


## Scan mode
The third mode of AutoTrader is scan mode, activated by setting the `scan` attribute to `True`. When activated, AutoTrader will run
as in livetrade mode, but instead of submitting an order to the broker when a signal is received, it will notify you that the scan 
criteria has been met. If email notifications are not activated (using the `notify` flag), the scan results will be printed to the 
console. 


### Market Scan Notifications
Email notifications require a host email account and a mailing list specified in the [global](configuration-global) and 
[strategy](configuration-strategy) files as appropriate. The extent of these notifications is controlled by the `notify`
attribute of AutoTrader in a similar way to the verbosity of the code.

|  `notify` value | Behaviour                                                   |
| :-------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0        | No emails will be sent.                                     |
|        1        | Emails will be sent each time the scanner gets a hit.       |
|        2        | Emails will be sent every time the scanner runs, regardless of whether or not a hit was detected. |



# Configuration
To configure the run settings of AutoTrader, the `configure` method should be used. This is mostly optional,
and if not used, AutoTrader will run with the defualt settings. If you are livetrading, however, you will need to
set the feed to match your broker and provide your trading account number.

```
def configure(feed='yahoo', verbosity=1, notify=0, home_dir=None,
              include_broker=False, use_stream=False, detach_bot=False,
              check_data_alignment=True, allow_dancing_bears=False,
              account_id=None, environment='demo', show_plot=False,
              MTF_initialisation=False):
```

## Parameters
The `configure` method has the following parameters.

```
Parameters:
  feed (str): the data feed to be used (eg. Yahoo, Oanda).
  
  verbosity (int): the verbosity of AutoTrader (0, 1 or 2).
  
  notify (int): the level of email notification (0, 1 or 2).
  
  home_dir (str): the project home directory.
  
  include_broker (bool): set to True to assign broker to strategy
  attributes.
  
  use_stream (bool): set to True to use price stream as data feed.
  
  detach_bot (bool): set to True to spawn new thread for each bot
  deployed.
  
  check_data_alignment (bool): verify time of latest candle in
  data recieved against current time.
  
  allow_dancing_bears (bool): allow incomplete candles to be 
  passed to strategy.
  
  account_id (str): the brokerage account ID to use in this instance.
  
  environment (str): the trading environment of this instance.
  
  show_plot (bool): automatically display plot of results.
  
  MTF_initialisation (bool): only download mutliple time frame 
  data when initialising the strategy, rather than every update.
```
