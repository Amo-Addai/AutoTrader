`./strategies/`

Your trading strategies are built as classes in the strategies/ directory of AutoTrader.

A template strategy class file can be found in the strategies directory.

Strategies have an warm-up period before running, in the initiation of the class.

The strategy must be initialised by ...

```python
def __init__(self, params, data, pair):
    ''' Define all indicators used in the strategy '''
    self.name   = "Strategy name"
    self.data   = data
    self.params = params

    # Path variables
    strat_dir       = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    self.home_dir   = os.path.join(strat_dir, '..')
```

If you wish to visualise any of the results from your strategy, you must also include information about which
indicators you would like to plot. This information is stored in `self.indicators', a dicttionary as defined 
below. This dictionary is passed to [AutoPlot](autoplot). 

```
self.indicators = {'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
                   'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
		  ...
                  }

```

Example

```
self.indicators = {'MACD (12/26/9)': {'type': 'MACD',
                                      'macd': self.MACD,
                                      'signal': self.MACDsignal,
                                      'histogram': self.MACDhist},
                   'EMA (200)': {'type': 'EMA',
                                 'data': self.ema200},
                   'RSI (14)': {'type': 'RSI',
                                'data': self.rsi14},
                   'RSI (7)': {'type': 'RSI',
                               'data': self.rsi7},
                   'EMA (21)': {'type': 'EMA',
                                'data': self.ema21}
                  }
```



The signal ...

Note that a dict of the current positions held with the broker is passed into the `generate_signal` function.
This means that your strategy can take into account the positions you currently hold. The most obvious use of this
is when trading instruments which cannot be shorted. In this case, you would only place a sell order when you 
currently have an open position. 
You might also wan't to avoid entering a trade if it contradicts the position you currently hold.
Refer to the [AutoTrader docs](autotrader) for more information about this dict.

```python
def generate_signal(self, i, current_positions):
    ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''

    # In this example, the strategy will place market orders.
    # Other order types are:
        # limit - to place a limit order
        # close - to close the current_position
    order_type  = 'market'
    signal_dict = {}

    # Put entry strategy here
    signal      = 0

    # Calculate exit targets
    exit_dict = self.generate_exit_levels(signal, i)

    # Construct signal dictionary
    signal_dict["order_type"]   = order_type
    signal_dict["direction"]    = signal
    signal_dict["stop_loss"]    = exit_dict["stop_loss"]
    signal_dict["stop_type"]    = exit_dict["stop_type"]
    signal_dict["take_profit"]  = exit_dict["take_profit"]

    return signal_dict
```


It is often useful to include a separate function for generating 

```python
def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
    ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''

    # Put exit strategy here
    stop = 0
    take = 0
    stop_type = 'limit'

    exit_dict = {'stop_loss'    : stop, 
                 'stop_type'    : stop_type,
                 'take_profit'  : take}

    return exit_dict
```


If you are building a strategy with no stop loss or take profit levels, use `np.nan` in place of
`stop` and `take`.
