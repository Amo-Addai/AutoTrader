# General Information
When you run a strategy in AutoTrader, a trading bot, or `AutoBot`, will be deployed for each instrument in your strategies 
watchlist. From that point on, the trading bot will continue to monitor that instrument with the rules of your strategy 
until it is terminated. This will depend on whether AutoTrader is run in detached bot mode, or periodic update mode.
