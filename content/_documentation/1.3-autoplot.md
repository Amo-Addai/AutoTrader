`autotrader.autoplot`

AutoPlot is the automated plotting module of AutoTrader. It is automatically used when visualising backtest results
or running a [scan](/AutoTrader/2021/09/27/developing-scanner.html). However, it can also be manually imported to 
easily visualise price data and indicators of candlestick data when developing strategies, as exemplified in this 
[blog post](/AutoTrader/2021/09/17/using-indiview.html).

As a plotting class, each instance of AutoPlot must be provided with price data in the form of OHLC data. A minimal 
working example is provided below to visualise the price data of Apple from the Yahoo finance feed of 
[AutoData](autodata). 

```py
from autotrader.autoplot import AutoPlot
from autotrader.lib.autodata import GetData

instrument = 'AAPL'
get_data = GetData()
data = get_data.yahoo(instrument, '1d', 
                      start_time='2020-01-01', 
                      end_time='2021-01-01')

ap = AutoPlot(data)
ap.plot(instrument=instrument)
```


# AutoPlot Module
The attributes of AutoPlot control the appearance of the charts generated. They are listed in the table below.

## Attributes

| Attribute     | Description  (default)  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `data` | OHLC DataFrame (`none`) |
| `max_indis_over` | Maximum number of indicators overlayed on OHLC chart (`3`) |
|`max_indis_below`| Maximum number of indicators plotted below OHLC chart (`2`) |
|`_modified_data`| *Internal attribute* |
|`fig_tools`| Figure tools to plot with (see [Bokeh docs](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html)) (`"pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,undo,redo,reset,save"`)|
|`ohlc_height`| Height of OHLC chart in px (`400`) |
|`ohlc_width`| Width of OHLC chart in px (`800`) |
|`top_fig_height`|Height of figure above OHLC chart (`150`) |
|`bottom_fig_height`|Height of figure below OHLC chart (`150`) |



## Methods
### Add Plot Tools
To customise the tools of the figures produced with AutoPlot, the `add_tool`
should be used. This method simply appends the `tool_name` to the `fig_tools`
attribute of the class instance. Refer to the 
[Bokeh documentation](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html) for details on the tools available.

```py
def add_tool(tool_name)
```


### Create Plot

The `plot` method is used to generate a chart. It is used in both backtest plotting and indicator viewing. 

```py
def plot(backtest_dict=None, indicators=None, 
         instrument=None, show_fig=True)
```

The inputs of this method are summarised in the table below. Note the the specification of the `indicators` dictionary 
is detailed in the [next section](#indicator-specification).

|Input|Type|Description|
|:----|:----|:----------|
|`backtest_dict`| `dict` | A dictionary containing a backtest trade history. |
|`indicators`| `dict` | A dictionary of indicators to plot. |
|`instrument`| `str` | The name of the instrument being plotted. | 
|`show_fig`| `bool` | Boolean flag to show or hide plot.| | 



# Usage

## Indicator Specification
To plot indicators with AutoPlot, you must provide a dictionary containing each indicator. This dictionary must be structured
according to the example provided below. 

```py
self.indicators = {'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
                   'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
		  ...
                  }

```

In this dictionary, each key 'indicator name' is used to create the legend entry corresponding to the 
indicator. The sub-dictionary assigned to each indicator contains the specific information and associated data. The `type` 
key should be a string corresponding to the type of indicator, as defined in the table below. It is used to determine whether 
the indicator should be plotted overlayed on the OHLC chart, or below it on a separate plot. Finally, the data associated with 
the indicator must also be provided. For indicators with one set of data, such as a moving average, simply provide the data with 
the `data` key. For indicators with multiple sets of data, such as MACD, provide a key for each set named according to the keys
specified in the table below.


| Indicator     | Type   | Keys                                  |
| :-----------: |:------:| :-----------------------------------: |
| MACD          |`MACD`  | `macd`, `signal`, `histogram`         |
| EMA           | `MA`   | `data`                                |
| SMA           | `MA`   | `data`|
| RSI | `RSI`| `data`|
| Stochastics |`STOCHASTIC`|`K`, `D`|
| Heikin-Ashi |`Heikin-Ashi`| `data`|
|Supertrend|`Supertrend`|`data`|
|Swings|`Swings`|`data`|
|Engulfing|`Engulfing`|`data`|
|Crossover|`Crossover`|`data`|


If an indicator type isn't recognised, AutoPlot will attempt to plot it as a line plot on a new chart below the OHLC chart using the `data` key
of the indicator. A warning message stating that the indicator is not recognised will also be printed.
Also note that a `type` key can be used for an indicator that isn't specified above if it has similar plotting behaviour.
See [indicators](indicators) for details on the indicators listed above.
