`./autoplot.py`

AutoPlot is the automated plotting module of AutoTrader. It is automatically used when visualising backtest results
or running a [scan](/2021/09/27/developing-scanner.html).

## Indicator Specification
To plot indicators with AutoPlot, you must provide a dictionary containing each indicator. This dictionary must be structured
according to the example provided below. 

```py
self.indicators = {'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
                   'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
		  ...
                  }

```

In this dictionary, each key 'indicator name' is used to create the legend entry corresponding to the 
indicator. The sub-dictionary assigned to each indicator contains the specific information and associated data. The `type` 
key should be a string corresponding to the type of indicator, as defined in the table below. It is used to determine whether 
the indicator should be plotted overlayed on the OHLC chart, or below it on a separate plot. Finally, the data associated with 
the indicator must also be provided. For indicators with one set of data, such as a moving average, simply provide the data with 
the `data` key. For indicators with multiple sets of data, such as MACD, provide a key for each set named according to the keys
specified in the table below.


| Indicator     | Type   | Keys                                  |
| :-----------: |:------:| :-----------------------------------: |
| MACD          |`MACD`  | `macd`, `signal`, `histogram`         |
| EMA           | `MA`   | `data`                                |
| SMA           | `MA`   | `data`|
| RSI | `RSI`| `data`|
| Stochastics |`STOCHASTIC`|`K`, `D`|
| Heikin-Ashi |`Heikin-Ashi`| `data`|
|Supertrend|`Supertrend`|`data`|
|Swings|`Swings`|`data`|
|Engulfing|`Engulfing`|`data`|
|Crossover|`Crossover`|`data`|


If an indicator type isn't recognised, AutoPlot will attempt to plot it as a line plot on a new chart below the OHLC chart using the `data` key
of the indicator. A warning message stating that the indicator is not recognised will also be printed.
Also note that a `type` key can be used for an indicator that isn't specified above if it has similar plotting behaviour.
See [indicators](indicators) for details on the indicators listed above.
