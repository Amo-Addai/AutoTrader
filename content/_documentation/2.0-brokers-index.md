## Virtual Broker
At the heart of AutoTrader's backtesting algorithm is the virtual broker, a Python class intended to replicate the functionality of a real broker. 

See the documentation of the [Virtual Broker](brokers-virtual) for more information.


## Oanda v20 REST API
AutoTrader supports Oanda's v20 REST API. This API is best suited for Foreign Exchange trading.

See the documentation of the [OANDA v20 REST API](brokers-oanda) for more information.


## Coming Soon
Support for the following API's is in development:
  - [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com.au/en/index.php?f=5041)
  - [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/)
