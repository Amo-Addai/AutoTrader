To make the transition from backtesting to live-trading as easy as possible, each broker integrated into AutoTrader 
interfaces with a strategy using a set of common methods. This means that the same strategy can be run with the 
virtual broker or any other broker in live trading without changing a single line of code in your strategy. This 
page provides a general overview of the methods contained within each broker interface module. Of course, the mechanics
behind each method will change depending on the broker, however each method will behave in the same way.


# Methods
The methods of the brokers are described below.




|           Method          | Function                                                                                              |

# Order Handling
An order can be created by providing the required information in a dictionary. This dictionary must be 
returned by a method named `generate_signal` in the [strategy module](strategies). This method is called 
from the `_update` method of the [AutoBot module](autobot#core-methods), and then processed by the 
`_process_signal` method. The contents of this dictionary will largely depend on the type of order, but at 
a minimum, it must contain the order type and trade direction. Possible keys for this dictionary are provided
in the table below. 


| Key | Description |  Specification  |
|-----|-------------|----|
| `order_type` | Order type | Required |
| `order_limit_price` | The | Required for `limit` or `stop-limit` order types |
| `direction` | Trade direction (1 for long or -1 for short trades) | Required |
| `size` | Trade size, specified in trade units | Optional |
| `take_profit` | Take profit, specified as price | Optional |
| `take_distance` | Take profit, specified in pips from entry price | Optional |
| `stop_loss` | Stop loss, specified as price | Optional |
| `stop_distance` | Stop loss, specified in pips from entry price | Optional |
| `stop_type` | Type of stop loss order | Optional |
| `related_orders` | A dictionary of related order numbers | Optional |




## Order Types

The following tables provides accepted values for the `order_type` specification of an order.

| Order Type | Description | Additional keys required |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `market`   | A market order type | None |
| `limit` | A limit order type | `order_limit_price` |
| `stop-limit` | A stop-limit order type | `order_limit_price` and `order_stop_price` |


### Market Order
A market order is 

`'order_type': 'market'`


### Limit Order
order_limit_price must be specified for limit orders


### Stop-Limit Order
order_stop_price must be specified for stop-limit order




### Stop Loss Types

| Stop Type | Description | Additional keys required |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| `limit` | A regular stop loss order | None |
| `trailing` | A trailing stop loss order | `stop_loss` or `stop_distance` |



`stop_price` always takes precedence over `stop_distance`. That is, if `stop_price` is provided along with a `stop_distance`, 
the stop loss will be set at the price defined by `stop_price`. 

AutoTrader is intelligent when it comes to order types. If your strategy has no stop loss, you do not need to include it in the 
signal dictionary. If you prefer to set a stop loss in terms of distance in pips, you can do that instead. Same goes for take 
profit levels, specify price or distance in pips. The choice is yours.
