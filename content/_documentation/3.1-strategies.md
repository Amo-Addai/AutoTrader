`./strategies/`


Trading strategies are built as classes and must be stored in a strategies/ directory of your 
[project](/AutoTrader/docs#project-directory-structure). This is so that AutoTrader can locate your strategy when running. Each
strategy is required to have two methods. The first is the `__init__` method, which initialises the strategy by 
pre-computing indicators used in the strategy logic. The second is the `generate_signal` method, which contains the 
strategy logic and ouputs a dictionary named `signal_dict`. Read more about these methods below and take a look at the sample
strategies in the [demo repository](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/autotrader-demo).


# Methods
A summary of the methods used in a strategy class is shown in the table below. Details of these methods are also provided. 

|           Method           | Function                                                                                           |
| :------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         `__init__`         | Initiates strategy by pre-computing indicators.                                                    |
|     `generate_signal`      | Generates a trade signal based on the strategy logic and current time index.                       |
|   `generate_exit_levels`   | (Optional) Helper function to calculate exit levels.                                               |



## Initialisation
The `__init__` method of a strategy initialises it with the following objects:
  1. `params`: a dictionary containing the strategy parameters from your strategy configuration file
  2. `data`: a dataframe of the instrument's price data 
  3. `instrument`: a string object with the instruments name

It is usually convenient to warm-start your strategy by pre-computing indicators and signals during the 
initialisation of the strategy.

```python
def __init__(self, params, data, pair):
    ''' Defines all indicators used in the strategy '''
    self.name   = "Strategy name"
    self.data   = data
    self.params = params

    # Calculate indicators here

    # Path variables
    strat_dir       = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    self.home_dir   = os.path.join(strat_dir, '..')
```

### Initialisation with access to the Broker
In some cases, you may like to directly connect with the broker from your strategy module. In this case, you would
include `INCLUDE_BROKER: True` in your [strategy configuration file](configuration-strategy). This will signal to 
AutoTrader to instantiate your strategy with the broker API and broker utilities. You will therefore need to include
these as inputs to your `__init__` method, as shown below. Now you can access the methods of the 
[broker API](brokers-interface) directly from your strategy!

```python
def __init__(self, params, data, pair, broker, broker_utilities):
    ''' Defines all indicators used in the strategy '''
    self.name   = "Strategy name"
    self.data   = data
    self.params = params
    self.broker = broker
    self.utils  = broker_utilities
```


### Indicators Dictionary
If you wish to visualise any of the results from your strategy, you must also include information about which
indicators you would like to plot. This information is stored in `self.indicators', a dictionary as defined 
below. This dictionary is passed to [AutoPlot](autoplot). 

```py
self.indicators = {'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
                   'indicator name': {'type': 'indicator type',
                                      'data': self.indicator_data},
		  ...
                  }

```

In this dictionary, the 'indicator name' is used to create a legend entry corresponding to the indicator. The sub-dictionary
assigned to each indicator contains the specific information and associated data. The `type` key should be a string corresponding
to the type of indicator, for example:
- `'type': 'MA'` for an exponential moving average (or any type of moving average)
- `'type': 'STOCH'` for stochastics
Finally, the data associated with the indicator must also be provided. For indicators with one set of data, such as a moving average,
simply provide the data with the `data` key. For indicators with multiple sets of data, such as MACD, provide a key for each set named
according to the [indicator specification](autoplot#indicator-specification).
See the example below for a strategy with MACD, two RSI's and two EMA's.

```py
self.indicators = {'MACD (12/26/9)': {'type': 'MACD',
                                      'macd': self.MACD,
                                      'signal': self.MACDsignal,
                                      'histogram': self.MACDhist},
                   'EMA (200)': {'type': 'MA',
                                 'data': self.ema200},
                   'RSI (14)': {'type': 'RSI',
                                'data': self.rsi14},
                   'RSI (7)': {'type': 'RSI',
                               'data': self.rsi7},
                   'EMA (21)': {'type': 'MA',
                                'data': self.ema21}
                  }
```


## Signal Generation
Signals are generated using the `generate_signal` method. This method contains the logic behind your strategy 
and returns a dictionary with details of the signal. The contents of the signal dictionary will largely depend 
on the order type, but at a minimum must contain the order type and trade direction. Read more about this
dictionary in the [*Broker API's* documentation](brokers-interface#order-handling).

Some boilerplate code for this method is provided below.

```python
def generate_signal(self, i, current_positions):
    ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''

    order_type  = 'market'
    signal_dict = {}

    # Put entry strategy here
    signal      = 0

    # Calculate exit targets
    exit_dict = self.generate_exit_levels(signal, i)

    # Construct signal dictionary
    signal_dict["order_type"]   = order_type
    signal_dict["direction"]    = signal
    signal_dict["stop_loss"]    = exit_dict["stop_loss"]
    signal_dict["stop_type"]    = exit_dict["stop_type"]
    signal_dict["take_profit"]  = exit_dict["take_profit"]

    return signal_dict
```

Note that a dict of the current positions held with the broker is passed into the `generate_signal` function.
This means that your strategy can take into account the positions you currently hold. The most obvious use of this
is when trading instruments which cannot be shorted. In this case, you would only place a sell order when you 
currently have an open position. 
You might also wan't to avoid entering a trade if it contradicts the position you currently hold.
Refer to the [AutoTrader docs](autotrader) for more information about this dict.




## Exit Signals
It is often useful to include a separate function for generating exit levels. In the code snippet above, a method
`self.generate_exit_levels` is called to generate an exit level dictionary, `exit_dict`. Although this is completely 
optional, it allows for complex exit strategies to be programmed. A template for this method is provided below.

```python
def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
    ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''

    # Put exit strategy here
    stop = None
    take = None
    stop_type = 'limit'

    exit_dict = {'stop_loss'    : stop, 
                 'stop_type'    : stop_type,
                 'take_profit'  : take}

    return exit_dict
```

If you are building a strategy with no stop loss or take profit levels, you can simply leave them out of the `signal_dict`
dictionary. This has the same effect as provide `None` to the stop loss and/or take profit keys.






# Order Types

*This section is currently in development. Please check back soon!*


AutoTrader is intelligent when it comes to order types. If your strategy has no stop loss, you do not need to include it in the 
signal dictionary. If you prefer to set a stop loss in terms of distance in pips, you can do that instead. Same goes for take 
profit levels, specify price or distance in pips. The choice is yours.


## Trade Order Types

| Order | Behaviour |
|:---------:| --------- |
| `market` | Order will be filled at the market price. |
| `limit` | Order will be filled at the limit price or better. |
| `stop-limit` | Order will only be placed when the limit price is hit. |


## Stop Loss Types

| Stop loss | Behaviour |
|:---------:| --------- |
| `limit`   | Regular stop loss - position will close when hit. |
|  `trailing` | Trailing stop loss. |


# Deployed Live-trade Strategies
If you will be deploying your strategy to livetrade using data from the price stream,
you will need to add the following attributes and methods to your strategy.

## Attributes
`self.terminate`


## Methods
`exit_strategy`
