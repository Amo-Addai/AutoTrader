The strategy configuration file 



Sizing: can either be 'risk' or an integer value, corresponding to number of units to trade.


Period: used to specify how many candles to retrieve when live trading. For example, if period takes the value of 300, the 
latest 300 candles will be downloaded. This number will depend on the strategy which you have implemented. If your strategy 
uses lagging indicators, the value of `period` should be *at least* as much as the slowest indicator period in your strategy.
