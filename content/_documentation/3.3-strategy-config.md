`./config/*.yaml`

The strategy configuration file contains information related specifically to a strategy. Each [strategy](strategies) requires
its own configuration file to be able to run. It is written as a [.yaml](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) 
file. Note that spacing is important in .yaml files, with each level defined by two subsequent spaces.

## Contents
A template strategy configuration file is provided below. Each file will look very similar to this, with the exception of the 
parameters entry, which will be tailored to your own strategy.

```
NAME: 'Strategy Name'
MODULE: 'modulename'
CLASS: 'StrategyClassName'
INTERVAL: 'M15'
PERIOD: 300
RISK_PC: 1
SIZING: 'risk'
PARAMETERS:
  ema_period: 200
  rsi_period: 14
  
  # Exit level parameters
  RR: 2
  stop_buffer: 10 # pips

# Define instruments to monitor
WATCHLIST: ['EUR_USD']
```


The keys of this file are described in the table below. Note that all parameters defined here will be accessible in the 
[strategy](strategies), via the `params` dictionary. 

| Key | Description |
|:---:|-------------|
|`MODULE`| A string containing the prefix name of the strategy module, without the *.py* suffix. |
|`NAME`| A string containing the class name within the strategy module. |
|`INTERVAL`| The granularity of the strategy, in the [format required](autodata) by the `FEED` (eg. 'M15')|
|`PERIOD`| The number of candles to fetch when live trading (eg. a value of 300 will fetch the latest 300 candles). |
|`SIZING`| The method to use when calculating position size. |
|`RISK_PC`| The percentage of the account balance to risk when determining position risk-based size.|
|`PARAMETERS`| A dictionary containing strategy parameters (see below).|


Some things to note:
- `SIZING` can be either `'risk'` or an integer value, corresponding to the number of units to trade.
- `PERIOD` is used to specify how many candles to retrieve when live trading. For example, if period takes the value of 300, the 
latest 300 candles will be downloaded. This number will depend on the strategy which you have implemented. If your strategy 
uses lagging indicators, the value of `PERIOD` should be *at least* as much as the slowest indicator period in your strategy.
- If you would like to build a strategy which uses multiple timeframes, simply specify the timeframes with comma separation in
the `INTERVAL` key. For example, to have access to 15-minute and 4-hour data, you would specify something like `INTERVAL: 'M15,H1'`.
In this case, the `data` object passed into the strategy will be a dictionary, with keys defined by each granularity specified
in `INTERVAL` and the associated data.


#### PARAMETERS
The parameters sub-dictionary of the `STRATEGY` key contains any information you would like to be able to access from your 
[strategy](strategies) module. Typically, this will include indicator configuration parameters, such as periods, and exit parameters, 
such as a risk-to-reward ratio. 


### WATCHLIST
The `WATCHLIST` key should be provided with a list of strings containing the instruments you would like to trade with the strategy.
