`./emailing/emailing.py`

AutoTrader has the ability to notify you of various events as it runs. Such events include:
- An order being placed
- A hit on a [market scan](autotrader#market-scan-notifications)
- A daily [order summary](autotrader#order-summary)
- A trade signal

The specific content and frequency of emails sent will depend on the verbosity level set by the `notify` 
[attribute](autotrader#autotrader-attributes) of autotrader.py. To recieve emails from AutoTrader, you must first set up 
a host email account and specify the details of the account in the [global configutration](configuration#global-config) file.
A guide to the levels set by the `notify` attribute is provided in the table below.


|  `notify` value | Behaviour                                                   |
| :-------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0        | No emails will be sent.                                     |
|        1        | Minimal emails will be sent (summaries only/scan hits only).|
|        2        | All possible emails will be sent (every order and summary/scan run notifications, even if not hits detected). |




## Daily Trade Reports
When running in [livetrade mode](autotrader#livetrade-mode), daily (or some other frequency) trade summaries can be sent by setting
`notify` to `1` or greater. When set greater than zero, AutoTrader will write the details of orders submitted to the broker into a 
log file. The email manager (discussed below) must then be used in a scheduled job to read this file at specified intervals, construct 
and send the order summary by email. These emails will take the form shown below.

### Emailing Manager
`./emailing/emailing.py`

As mentioned above, the email manager must be employed if periodic trade summaries are desired by email. This is because AutoTrader is 
run on regular intervals by a job scheduler, and does not store a history of trades taken. Therefore, when `notify` is set to a value
greater than zero, it will write order details to a text file. Next, when the email manager is provided with this text file, 
named "order_history.txt" by default, it will read the contents of the file, pass it to the emailing module to send off, and then delete 
the order history file. This ensures that orders will not be repeated in emails.


## Trade Notifications
When running in [livetrade mode](autotrader#livetrade-mode), notifications of orders placed through AutoTrader will be sent 
when `notify` is set to `2`. These emails will contain key order information, such as that shown below.

> Dear Mr Mackle,
>
> A market order has been placed for -15103 units of EUR/USD following an entry signal recieved 
> by MACD Trend Strategy.
>
> A summary of the entry signal is provided below.
>
> | Pair        | EUR/USD        |
> | :---------- |:-------------: |
> | Size        | -15103         |
> | Price       | 1.18003        |
> | Stop loss   | 1.18181 (17.7) |
> | Take profit | 1.17818 (18.6) |



## Market Scan Notifications
When AutoTrader is run in scan mode with `notify` set to `1` or greater, emails will be sent each time the scan detects the market 
conditions being scanned for. If `notify` is set to `2`, emails will be sent every time the scan runs, even if it does not detect a hit.
