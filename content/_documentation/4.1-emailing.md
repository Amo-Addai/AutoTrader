AutoTrader has the ability to notify you of various events as it runs. Such events include:
- An order being placed
- A hit on a [market scan](autotrader#market-scan-notifications)
- A daily [order summary](autotrader#order-summary)
- A trade signal


See the [Global Config](configuration#global-config) for more information.


Discuss notification output level using -n flag.
