`./lib/environment_manager.py`

The environment manager is used to create a broker configuration dictionary based on the trading 
[environment](configuration-strategy#environment), [global configuration](configuration-global) and 
[data feed](configuration-strategy#feed). The dictionary returned will be similar to that shown below.


```py
config_dict = {'data_source'    : data_source,
               'API'            : api, 
               'ACCESS_TOKEN'   : access_token, 
               'ACCOUNT_ID'     : account_id, 
               'PORT'           : port}
```
