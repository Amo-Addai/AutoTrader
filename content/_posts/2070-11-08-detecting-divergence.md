# Motivation

# Building the Indicator

## Detecting price reversals

find_swings indicator

alternatively, pivot points. However, tradingview pivot points are very lagging, 
i want something quicker


## Support and Resistance

Detecting significant support and resistance levels using the price reversals

When an established reversal levels survives for more than 2 candles 
(ie. it is not broken)
2 is what was used, this is general

This filters regular fluctuations


## Filtering

Now we want to filter for strong high levels, and strong low levels


### First occurrence
Detect first occurance of strong high or low levels

# Detecting Divergence

Combine the tools and indicators developed above on price and an indicator of choice, to detect 
divergence. 

Use RSI as an example, but other indicators can be used.

Maybe also show for MACD







# What Now?

The tools above have been combined into the indicators;
find_swings()
detect_divergence()

added to AutoTrader [indicator library]().


Next steps,
Implement into a strategy, backtest
