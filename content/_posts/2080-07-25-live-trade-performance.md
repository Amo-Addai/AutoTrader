This post marks the first in a series documenting the performance of my 



Although AutoTrader is a completely free-to-use software package, I feel that this series of posts is important to validate the functionality of the framework.


# Strategy
In the interest of maintaining an edge, I will not be revealing the details of my strategy. However, I will provide the following generalities:
- the characteristics of the algorithm change depending on market conditions (ie. ranging or trending)
- The strategy is portfolio-based.
- I will be trading currencies and indices 
- all trades and orders are placed through AutoTrader, but trades will be supervised daily to ensure expected behaviour.
- all trades have clearly defined entries and exits. Outside of the price range defined by these points, the bot trading the strategy will be terminated.
- position sizes are calculated based on risk management principles.
- the trading account has 30:1 leverage 

Hopefully, many of these points are not very surprising or insightful - they are simply good practices of trading. 

A final comment about the strategy is that it is possibly the most simple strategy I have tested to date. Despite spending countless hours trawling through YouTube and reading through trading forums, 

So why do I believe in this strategy? Because it is built upon risk management... etc
