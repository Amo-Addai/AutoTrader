This guide is intended to help you get up and running with AutoTrader as quickly as possible. To be as accessible as 
possible, an example of a simple moving average crossover strategy will be used. Do not worry though, the strategies
that can be run with AutoTrader can be far more complex than this.

Start with the [getting AutoTrader](./getting-autotrader) guide, or click a link on the sidebar.

If you would prefer a one-page reference for running AutoTrader, check out the 
[complete quick start guide](./quick-start).
