## Installation

AutoTrader can be installed in two ways; through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or by cloning the repository directly.

### PyPI Install
The easiest way to get AutoTrader is by running the following command.

```
pip install autotrader
```

This will automatically install all dependencies (except TaLib, which requires additional attention, see below) when run.
It is recommended for most users of AutoTrader.


### Clone from GitHub
If you are interested in helping with the development of AutoTrader, or would like to view the source code while you 
work, cloning from GitHub is the preferred way of getting AutoTrader. In this method, clone the 
[Github repository](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/AutoTrader) onto your machine 
and install the required [dependencies](#dependencies).

```
git clone https://github.com/kieran-mackle/AutoTrader
```


## Dependencies

AutoTrader has the following dependencies:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [TaLib](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/)
- [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)

With the exception of TaLib (see below), these dependencies will be installed automatically when you
run `pip install autotrader`.


### Installing TaLib
TaLib is a **T**echnical **a**nalysis **Lib**rary written in C, widely used in financial software to perform technical
analysis of financial market data. Although use of TaLib is completely optional, it is extremely useful while developing
strategies. To use TaLib in AutoTrader, you must first download the C source code, and then download the python wrapper.

[This article](https://www.programmersought.com/article/32601617503/) provides all the information needed to install 
TaLib on your operating system. If you are using linux, you can use the commands below.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.6-dev
pip3 install numpy -i https://pypi.doubanio.com/simple
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd ta-lib
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
cd ..
pip install TA-Lib
```
