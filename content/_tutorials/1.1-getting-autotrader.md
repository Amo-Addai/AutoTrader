# Installation

AutoTrader can be installed in two ways; through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or by cloning the repository directly.

## PyPI Install
The easiest way to get AutoTrader is by running the following command. It is recommended method of installation.

```
pip install autotrader
```

## Clone from GitHub
If you are interested in developing AutoTrader, or would like to view the source code while you work, cloning from 
GitHub is the way to get AutoTrader. In this method, clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/AutoTrader) 
onto your machine and run the `setup.py` file to install.

```
git clone https://github.com/kieran-mackle/AutoTrader
python3 setup.py install
```

You can also perform an [editable install](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0660/) to avoid re-installing the source code
each time you make a change.


## Demo Repository
To make getting started with AutoTrader even easier, download the demo repository from
[here](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/autotrader-demo). This repo contains example strategies, config files, 
run files and everything else you might need.

```
git clone https://github.com/kieran-mackle/autotrader-demo/ 
```


# Dependencies

AutoTrader has the following dependencies:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
- [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
- [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/)
- [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
- [finta](https://pypi.org/project/finta/0.3.3/)

These dependencies will be installed automatically when you install AutoTrader.


## Installing TaLib
TaLib is a **T**echnical **a**nalysis **Lib**rary written in C, widely used in financial software to perform technical
analysis of financial market data. Although use of TaLib is completely optional, it is extremely useful while developing
strategies. To use TaLib in AutoTrader, you must first download the C source code, and then download the python wrapper.

[This article](https://www.programmersought.com/article/32601617503/) provides all the information needed to install 
TaLib on your operating system. If you are using linux, you can use the commands below.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.6-dev
pip3 install numpy -i https://pypi.doubanio.com/simple
wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd ta-lib
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
cd ..
pip install TA-Lib
```

The alternative to TaLib is [finta](https://pypi.org/project/finta/0.3.3/), which is much easier to install and implemented
using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

*As of AutoTrader version 0.4.14, finta has become the preffered package for technical analysis.*
