*Note: the MACD crossover strategy shown in the following tutorials can be found in the*
*[demo repository](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/autotrader-demo).*

## Directory Organisation
Before building a strategy in AutoTrader, it is important to understand the structure of a project. At a minimum, any 
strategy you run in AutoTrader requires two things: 
1. A strategy module, containing all the logic of your strategy, and
2. A configuration file, containing any strategy configuration parameters.

If you plan to take your strategy [live](live-trading), you will also need a [global configuration](../docs/configuration-global) 
file to connect to your broker, but we will get to that later. For now, the files above are enough to get started backtesting, so
this tutorial will go over setting them up.

Back to your directory structure: you must have a `config/` directory - containing your configuration files - and a 
`strategies/` directory - containing (you guessed it) your [strategy files](../docs/strategies). When you 
run AutoTrader, it will look for the appropriate files under these directories. If you cloned the demo repository, you will
see these directories set up already.
```
your_trading_project/
  |- config/
  |    |- GLOBAL.yaml
  |    |- your_strategy_config.yaml
  |- strategies/
  |    |- your_strategy.py
  |- run_script.py
```


## Strategy Construction
*Follow along in the [demo repository](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/autotrader-demo): strategies/macd.py*

Now we can get onto building the strategy - the simple yet effective MACD crossover. An important note here is that this strategy assumes
that the underlying asset is a *contract for difference*, and hence, can be shorted. The rules for this strategy are as follows.

1. Trade in the direction of the trend, as determined by the 200EMA.
2. Enter a long position when the MACD line crosses *up* over the signal line, and enter a short when the MACD line crosses *down* below 
the signal line.
3. To ensure only the strongest MACD signals, the crossover must occur below the histogram zero line for long positions, and above the histogram 
zero line for short positions.
3. Stop losses are set at recent price swings/significant price levels.
4. Take profit levels are set at 1:1.5 risk-to-reward.

An example of a long entry signal from this strategy is shown in the image below (generated using 
[AutoTrader IndiView](../features/visualisation)).

Strategies in AutoTrader are built as classes, instantiated with parameters from the configuration file, instrumnet price data and 
the name of the instrument being traded - but don't worry, most of this is taken care of behind the scenes. The `params` dict is 
read in from the strategy configuration file and contains all strategy-specific parameters. By providing the data to the strategy upfront, 
they have a warm-up period before running, calculating all indicators when instantiated. The instrument being traded is also passed in 
to allow for more complex trading systems. More on this later.

Although strategy construction is flexible, the class must, at a minimum, contain the `__init__` function and a 
method named `generate_signal`, as shown below. Often, it is also convenient to define an exit strategy. In the example below, this is 
contained within the `generate_exit_levels` method. The details of these methods follow.

```py
# Import packages

class SimpleMACD:
    def __init__(self, params, data, pair):
        ''' Define all indicators used in the strategy '''
        
    def generate_signal(self, i, current_position):
        ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''
        ...
        return signal_dict
    
    def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
        ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''
        ...
        return exit_dict
```

We will start by building the strategy module, and finish with the strategy configuration file.


### Instantiation
All indicators used in the strategy are calculated when the strategy is instantiated from within AutoTrader. For the MACD crossover strategy,
this will look as shown below. Note the following:
- the package `talib` is used to calculate the 200 EMA and the MACD
- the custom indicator `crossover` is used from the [built-in indicators](../docs/indicators#crossover)
- the fast, slow and smoothing periods of the MACD are defined in the `params` dictionary by the names of 'MACD_fast', 'MACD_slow' and 'MACD_smoothing`. These parameters come straight from our configuration file (defined below).
- an `indicators` dict is defined to tell [AutoPlot](../docs/autoplot) which indicators to plot, and what to call them.
- the custom indicator `find_swings` is used to detect swings in the price, which will be used in the exit strategy.

```python
# Import packages
import talib
from autotrader.lib import indicators

class SimpleMACD:
    def __init__(self, params, data, pair):
        ''' Define all indicators used in the strategy '''
        self.name   = "Simple MACD Trend Strategy"
        self.data   = data
        self.params = params
        
        # 200EMA
        self.ema    = talib.EMA(data.Close.values, params['ema_period'])
        
        # MACD
        self.MACD, self.MACDsignal, self.MACDhist = talib.MACD(data['Close'].values, 
                                                  self.params['MACD_fast'], 
                                                  self.params['MACD_slow'], 
                                                  self.params['MACD_smoothing']
                                                  )
        self.MACD_CO        = indicators.crossover(self.MACD, self.MACDsignal)
        self.MACD_CO_vals   = indicators.cross_values(self.MACD, 
                                                      self.MACDsignal,
                                                      self.MACD_CO)
        # Construct indicators dict for plotting
        self.indicators = {'MACD (12/26/9)': {'type': 'MACD',
                                              'macd': self.MACD,
                                              'signal': self.MACDsignal,
                                              'histogram': self.MACDhist},
                           'EMA (200)': {'type': 'MA',
                                         'data': self.ema}}
        
        # Price swings
        self.swings     = indicators.find_swings(data)
```

Now we have everything we need to define the logic of the strategy.



### Strategy Signals

The next step is to define the signal generation function, `generate_signal`. Make sure to use this name for all your strategies, as
AutoTrader will try calling it when you run it. This method is where the logic of the strategy sits. The inputs to this function are `i`, 
an indexing variable, and `current_positions`, a dictionary containing current positions held. 

Since the price data and all of your indicators are pre-loaded when your strategy is instantiated, the indexing
variable `i` is required to generate a signal at the correct time. When backtesting with AutoTrader, the value 
of `i` will vary from `0` to `len(data)`, as AutoTrader steps through each bar in your data. If you are running
AutoTrader in live-trade mode, `i` will simply index the last candle in the data, corresponding to the latest 
market conditions. Read more about the indexing system [here](../docs/autotrader#data-indexing).

The output of this function is a dictionary, `signal_dict`, containing the details of your signal. AutoTrader supports
multiple order types, multiple stop loss types and anything else you might encounter with a real broker. For this strategy,
we will just be placing market orders when we get the entry signal. A long trade is triggered by setting the 'direction' key of 
the `signal_dict` to `1`, and a short trade is triggered by setting the it to `-1`. If there is no signal, set this key to `0`, 
and nothing will happen. We also define our exit targets by the `stop_loss` and `take_profit` keys of `signal_dict`. These 
price targets come from our exit strategy, defined below. 

```python
    def generate_signal(self, i, current_position):
        ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''
        
        order_type  = 'market'
        signal_dict = {}
        related_orders  = None
        
        if self.data.Close.values[i] > self.ema[i] and \    # Price is above 200 EMA
            self.MACD_CO[i] == 1 and \                      # MACD cross above signal line
            self.MACD_CO_vals[i] < 0:                       # MACD cross occured below zero
                # Long entry signal
                signal = 1
                
        elif self.data.Close.values[i] < self.ema[i] and \  # Price is below 200 EMA
            self.MACD_CO[i] == -1 and \                     # MACD cross below signal line
            self.MACD_CO_vals[i] > 0:                       # MACD cross occured above zero 
                # short entry signal
                signal = -1

        else:
            # No signal
            signal = 0
        
        # Calculate exit targets
        exit_dict = self.generate_exit_levels(signal, i)
        
        # Construct signal dictionary
        signal_dict["order_type"]   = order_type
        signal_dict["direction"]    = signal
        signal_dict["stop_loss"]    = exit_dict["stop_loss"]
        signal_dict["stop_type"]    = exit_dict["stop_type"]
        signal_dict["take_profit"]  = exit_dict["take_profit"]
        
        return signal_dict
```

*Refer to the [broker docs](../docs/brokers-virtual) for more information about the supported order types.*



### Exit Signals
As with any good strategy, we must define an exit strategy to manage risk. In this strategy, stop losses are set at recent swings in price. Since
this is a trend following strategy, market structure tells us that price is unlikely to break past a recent swing level, unless of course the 
trend is reversing. The `find_swings` indicator built into AutoTrader's [indicator library](../docs/indicators#price-swing-detection) makes 
this an easy task. Finally, take profits are set at 1:1.5 risk-to-reward. This is all completed with the code below.

```
    def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
        ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''
        
        stop_type   = 'limit'
        RR          = self.params['RR']
        
        if signal == 0:
            stop    = None
            take    = None
        else:
            if signal == 1:
                stop    = self.swings.Lows[i]
                take    = self.data.Close[i] + RR*(self.data.Close[i] - stop)
            else:
                stop    = self.swings.Highs[i]
                take    = self.data.Close[i] - RR*(stop - self.data.Close[i])
                
        
        exit_dict   = {'stop_loss'    : stop, 
                       'stop_type'    : stop_type,
                       'take_profit'  : take}
        
        return exit_dict
```



## Strategy Configuration
The next step is to write the [strategy configuration](../docs/configuration-strategy) yaml file. This file is a convenient place to define 
your strategy parameters (using `PARAMETERS`) and which instruments to trade with using this strategy (using `WATCHLIST`), backtesting 
parameters (`BACKTESTING`). As you can see below, the default MACD settings of 12/26/9 are used. The risk-to-reward ratio is also defined
by the `RR` key. As mentioned previously, this file is read by AutoTrader and passed into your strategy when it is instantiated. We will start
by backtesting with the EUR/USD, but to make things interesting, AutoTrader supports multi-instrument backtesting. This will be showcased later on.
