*Note: the MACD crossover strategy shown in the following tutorials can be found in the*
*[demo repository](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/autotrader-demo).*

## Directory Organisation
Before building a strategy in AutoTrader, it is important to understand the structure of a project. At a minimum, any 
strategy you run in AutoTrader requires two things: 
1. A strategy module, containing all the logic of your strategy, and
2. A configuration file, containing any strategy configuration parameters

If you plan to take your strategy [live](live-trading), you will also need a [global configuration](../docs/configuration-global) 
file to connect to your broker, but we will get to that later. For now, the files above are enough to get started backtesting.

Back to your directory structure: you must have a `config/` directory - containing your configuration files - and a 
`strategies/` directory - containing (you guessed it) your [strategy files](../docs/strategies). When you 
run AutoTrader, it will look for the appropriate files under these directories. If you cloned the demo repository, you will
see these directories set up already.
```
your_trading_project/
  |- config/
  |    |- GLOBAL.yaml
  |    |- your_strategy_config.yaml
  |- strategies/
  |    |- your_strategy.py
  |- run_script.py
```


## Strategy Construction
*Follow along in the [demo repository](https://github.com/kieran-mackle/autotrader-demo): strategies/macd.py*

Now we can get onto building the strategy - the simple yet effective MACD crossover. An important note here is that this strategy assumes
that the underlying asset is a *contract for difference*, and hence, can be shorted. The rules for this strategy are as follows.

1. Trade in the direction of the trend, as determined by the 200EMA.
2. Enter a long position when the MACD line crosses *up* over the signal line, and enter a short when the MACD line crosses *down* below 
the signal line.
3. To ensure only the strongest MACD signals, the crossover must occur below the histogram zero line for long positions, and above the histogram 
zero line for short positions.
3. Stop losses are set at recent price swings/significant price levels.
4. Take profit levels are set at 1:1.5 risk-to-reward.

This strategy is summarised in the image below (generated using [AutoTrader IndiView](../features/visualisation)).













Strategies in AutoTrader are built as classes, instantiated with strategy parameters, price data and the instrument
being traded - but don't worry, most of this is handled behind the scenes. The `params` dict is read in from the 
strategy configuration file and contains all strategy-specific
parameters. By providing the data upfront, strategies have a warm-up period before running, calculating all indicators 
when instantiated. The instrument being traded is also passed in to allow for more complex trading systems. More on 
this later.

Although strategy construction is flexible, the class must, at a minimum, contain the `__init__` function and a 
method named `generate_signal`, as shown below.

```
# Import packages

class SimpleMACD:
    def __init__(self, params, data, pair):
        ''' Define all indicators used in the strategy '''
        
    def generate_signal(self, i, current_position):
        ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''
        ...
        return signal_dict
    
    def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
        ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''
        ...
        return exit_dict
```





### Instantiation
All indicators used in the strategy are calculated when the strategy is instantiated. For the EMA crossover strategy,
this will look as shown below. Note the following:
- the package `talib` is used to calculate the EMA's
- the custom indicator `crossover` is used from the [built-in indicators](../docs/indicators)
- the period of both the fast and the slow EMA are defined in the `params` dict, name 'slow_ema' and 'fast_ema'
- an `indicators` dict is defined to tell [AutoPlot](../docs/autoplot) which indicators to plot, and what to call them

```
# Import packages
import talib
from autotrader.lib import indicators

class SimpleMACD:
    def __init__(self, params, data, pair):
        ''' Define all indicators used in the strategy '''
        self.name   = "Simple MACD Trend Strategy"
        self.data   = data
        self.params = params
        
        # 200EMA
        self.ema    = talib.EMA(data.Close.values, params['ema_period'])
        
        # MACD
        self.MACD, self.MACDsignal, self.MACDhist = talib.MACD(data['Close'].values, 
                                                  self.params['MACD_fast'], 
                                                  self.params['MACD_slow'], 
                                                  self.params['MACD_smoothing']
                                                  )
        self.MACD_CO        = indicators.crossover(self.MACD, self.MACDsignal)
        self.MACD_CO_vals   = indicators.cross_values(self.MACD, 
                                                      self.MACDsignal,
                                                      self.MACD_CO)
        # Construct indicators dict for plotting
        self.indicators = {'MACD (12/26/9)': {'type': 'MACD',
                                              'macd': self.MACD,
                                              'signal': self.MACDsignal,
                                              'histogram': self.MACDhist},
                           'EMA (200)': {'type': 'MA',
                                         'data': self.ema}}
        
        # Price swings
        self.swings     = indicators.find_swings(data)
```

Now we have everything we need to define the logic of the strategy.



### Entry Signals

The next step is to define the signal generation function, `generate_signal`. This is where the logic of
the strategy sits. The inputs to this function are `i`, an indexing variable, and `current_positions`, a 
dictionary containing current positions held. 

Since the price data and all of your indicators are pre-loaded when your strategy is instantiated, the indexing
variable `i` is required to generate a signal at the correct time. When backtesting with AutoTrader, the value 
of `i` will vary from `0` to `len(data)`, as AutoTrader steps through each bar in your data. If you are running
AutoTrader in live-trade mode, `i` will simply index the last candle in the data, corresponding to the latest 
market conditions. Read more about the indexing system [here](../docs/autotrader#data-indexing).

```
    def generate_signal(self, i, current_position):
        ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''
        
        order_type  = 'market'
        signal_dict = {}
        related_orders  = None
        
        if self.data.Close.values[i] > self.ema[i] and \
            self.MACD_CO[i] == 1 and \
            self.MACD_CO_vals[i] < 0:
                signal = 1
                
        elif self.data.Close.values[i] < self.ema[i] and \
            self.MACD_CO[i] == -1 and \
            self.MACD_CO_vals[i] > 0:
                signal = -1

        else:
            signal = 0
        
        # Calculate exit targets
        exit_dict = self.generate_exit_levels(signal, i)
        
        # Construct signal dictionary
        signal_dict["order_type"]   = order_type
        signal_dict["direction"]    = signal
        signal_dict["stop_loss"]    = exit_dict["stop_loss"]
        
        signal_dict["stop_type"]    = exit_dict["stop_type"]
        signal_dict["take_profit"]  = exit_dict["take_profit"]
        signal_dict["related_orders"] = related_orders
        
        return signal_dict
```





### Exit Signals


```
    def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
        ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''
        
        stop_type   = 'limit'
        RR          = self.params['RR']
        
        if signal == 0:
            stop    = None
            take    = None
        else:
            if signal == 1:
                stop    = self.swings.Lows[i]
                take    = self.data.Close[i] + RR*(self.data.Close[i] - stop)
            else:
                stop    = self.swings.Highs[i]
                take    = self.data.Close[i] - RR*(stop - self.data.Close[i])
                
        
        exit_dict   = {'stop_loss'    : stop, 
                       'stop_type'    : stop_type,
                       'take_profit'  : take}
        
        return exit_dict
```




## Strategy Configuration
Assuming that you have already set up the [global configuration](../docs/configuration-global), the next step is to 
build your [strategy configuration](../docs/configuration-strategy) file. This file tells AutoTrader where to get 
price data from (`FEED`), which instruments to trade (`WATCHLIST`), backtesting parameters (`BACKTESTING`) and 
what strategy parameters to use (`STRATEGY`).

As you can see below, our slow EMA has a period of 20, and our fast EMA has a period of 10.

```

            'AUDJPY=X']
```

For this guide, consider an exponential moving average (EMA) crossover strategy traded 
on stocks of Apple, ticker AAPL.
This strategy consists of two EMA's: a fast EMA and a slow EMA. The rules are simple;
- buy when the fast EMA crosses above the slow EMA
- sell when the fast EMA crosses below the slow EMA

This simple strategy is shown in the image below. The fast EMA (red line) crosses up above the slow EMA (blue line), signalling
time to buy. When the fast EMA crosses back below the slow EMA, it's time to exit the position and sell.

![EMA crossover strategy](../assets/images/ema_cross_signals.png "EMA Crossover Strategy Entry and Exit Signals")

Strategies in AutoTrader are built as classes, instantiated with strategy parameters, price data and the instrument
being traded. The `params` dict is read in from the strategy configuration file and contains all strategy-specific
parameters. By providing the data upfront, strategies have a warm-up period before running, calculating all indicators 
when instantiated. The instrument being traded is also passed in to allow for more complex trading systems. More on 
this later.

Although strategy construction is flexible, the class must, at a minimum, contain the `__init__` function and a 
method named `generate_signal`, as shown below.

```python
class ClassName():
    def __init__(self, params, data, instrument):
        ...
    def generate_signal(self, i, current_position):
        ...
```

### Instantiation
All indicators used in the strategy are calculated when the strategy is instantiated. For the EMA crossover strategy,
this will look as shown below. Note the following:
- the package `talib` is used to calculate the EMA's
- the custom indicator `crossover` is used from the [built-in indicators](../docs/indicators)
- the period of both the fast and the slow EMA are defined in the `params` dict, name 'slow_ema' and 'fast_ema'
- an `indicators` dict is defined to tell [AutoPlot](../docs/autoplot) which indicators to plot, and what to call them

```python
def __init__(self, params, data, instrument):
    ''' Define all indicators used in the strategy '''
    self.name   = "Strategy name"
    self.data   = data
    self.params = params
    
    # EMA's
    self.slow_ema = talib.EMA(self.data.Close.values, 
                              self.params['slow_ema'])
    
    self.fast_ema = talib.EMA(self.data.Close.values, 
                              self.params['fast_ema'])
    
    self.crossovers = crossover(self.fast_ema, 
                                self.slow_ema)
    
    # Construct indicators dict for plotting
    self.indicators = {'Fast EMA': {'type': 'MA',
                                    'data': self.fast_ema},
                        'Slow EMA': {'type': 'MA',
                                    'data': self.slow_ema}
                        }

```

Now we have everything we need to define the logic of the strategy.


### Entry Signals

The next step is to define the signal generation function, `generate_signal`. This is where the logic of
the strategy sits. The inputs to this function are `i`, an indexing variable, and `current_positions`, a 
dictionary containing current positions held. 

Since the price data and all of your indicators are pre-loaded when your strategy is instantiated, the indexing
variable `i` is required to generate a signal at the correct time. When backtesting with AutoTrader, the value 
of `i` will vary from `0` to `len(data)`, as AutoTrader steps through each bar in your data. If you are running
AutoTrader in live-trade mode, `i` will simply index the last candle in the data, corresponding to the latest 
market conditions. Read more about the indexing system [here](../docs/autotrader#data-indexing).

Since we are trading AAPL, we cannot sell stocks which we do not own (short selling), unless we are actually
trading contracts for difference (CFD's). As such, we need the dictionary of current positions to check whether
we should be looking for entry or exit signals. If the length of dictionary is zero, we do not have any currently
open positions, and so can look for entry signals: a crossover value of 1, implying that the fast EMA has just 
crossed *above* the slow EMA. If the length of the dictionary is not zero, it means that we currently have an open
position, and should only be looking to close the position following an exit signal: a crossover value of -1, 
implying that the fast EMA has just crossed *below* the slow EMA.

The final component is to package the signal into the `signal_dict` output, which is passed back to AutoTrader to
handle from there.

```python
def generate_signal(self, i, current_positions):
    ''' Define strategy to determine entry signals '''
    order_type      = 'market'
    related_orders  = None
    signal_dict     = {}
    
    # Put entry strategy here
    signal      = 0
    if len(current_position) == 0:
        # Not currently in any position, okay to enter long
        if self.crossovers[i] == 1:
            # Fast EMA has crossed above slow EMA, enter long
            signal = 1
    else:
        # Already in a position, only look for long exits
        if self.crossovers[i] == -1:
            signal = -1
            related_orders = list(current_position.keys())[0]
            order_type = 'close'
    
    # Calculate exit targets
    exit_dict = self.generate_exit_levels(signal, i)
    
    # Construct signal dictionary
    signal_dict["order_type"]   = order_type
    signal_dict["direction"]    = signal
    signal_dict["stop_loss"]    = exit_dict["stop_loss"]
    signal_dict["stop_type"]    = exit_dict["stop_type"]
    signal_dict["take_profit"]  = exit_dict["take_profit"]
    signal_dict["related_orders"] = related_orders
    
    return signal_dict
```


### Exit Signals
While our EMA strategy is very simple and clear cut, it is often useful to include a separate function for generating 
exit signals and levels. For example, stop loss and take profit targets. In this example, no stop losses or take 
profits are used, so `np.nan` is passed for each. However, this structure allows for much more 
[complex trading systems](../blog).

```python
def generate_exit_levels(self, signal, i):
    ''' Function to determine stop loss and take profit levels '''

    # Put exit strategy here
    stop = np.nan
    take = np.nan
    stop_type = 'limit'
    
    exit_dict = {'stop_loss'    : stop, 
                  'stop_type'    : stop_type,
                  'take_profit'  : take}
    
    return exit_dict
```

## Strategy Configuration
Assuming that you have already set up the [global configuration](../docs/configuration-global), the next step is to 
build your [strategy configuration](../docs/configuration-strategy) file. This file tells AutoTrader where to get 
price data from (`FEED`), which instruments to trade (`WATCHLIST`), backtesting parameters (`BACKTESTING`) and 
what strategy parameters to use (`STRATEGY`).
