`AutoTrader/lib/autodata.py`

AuotTrader is compatible with all kinds of price data, regardless of the instrument being traded. This means that
it can be used for stocks, cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, futures, options, commodities and even Mars 
bars - provided that you can get price data for them.
Luckily for you, AutoTrader is capable of retrieving price data for [supported instruments](../docs/brokers) automatically 
using the utility function [AutoData](../docs/autodata). All you have to do is provide a few details in the 
[configuration files](../docs/configuration) and AutoTrader will take care of the rest.

If you would prefer to provide your own price data, you can simply pass the filename to AutoTrader using the `--data` (`-d` 
for short) flag.

any data feeds in the configuration files, just make sure to specify the instruments in the same way they are listed on

To get forex price data, you may use Yahoo Finance or Oanda's v20 REST API. If using Yahoo Finance, you simply need to 
specify 


### Cryptocurrencies
