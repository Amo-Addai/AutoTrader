Now that you have [defined a strategy](strategy) and written the strategy [configuration file](../docs/configuration), you can
have some fun with backtesting. 


## Running the Backtest
To run AutoTrader in [backtest mode](../docs/autotrader#backtest-mode), begin by importing AutoTrader and creating an instance
using `at = AutoTrader()`. Next, set the verbosity of the code to `1`, so that we can get some results printed to the console. Next,
add a strategy using the `add_strategy` method. Next, use the `backtest` method to define your backtest settings. In this example, 
we are only going to set the start and end dates of the backtest, as well as the leverage of our account with the 
[virtual broker](../docs/brokers-virtual). You can also define a commission here, as well as an average bid/ask price spread. We
also set `at.show_plot` to True, so that we get a nice plot when the backtest is complete. Finally, we run AutoTrader with the 
command `at.run()`.

```python
from autotrader.autotrader import AutoTrader

at = AutoTrader()
at.verbosity = 1
at.add_strategy('macd')
at.backtest(start = '1/1/2020',
            end = '1/1/2021',
            leverage = 30)
at.show_plot = True
at.run()
```


## Backtest Results
With a verbosity of 1, you will see an output similar to that shown below. As you can see, there is a detailed breakdown of 
trades taken during the backtest period. Since we told AutoTrader to plot the results, you will also see the interactive chart
shown [below](#interactive-chart).
