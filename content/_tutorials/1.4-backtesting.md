Now that you have [defined a strategy](strategy) and written the [configuration files](../docs/configuration), you can
have some fun with backtesting. 


## Running the Backtest
To run AutoTrader in [backtest mode](../docs/autotrader#backtest-mode), set `AutoTrader.backtest` to `True`. How you do 
this will depend on if you are running AutoTrader from a run file or from the command line. Other useful properties to set
include:
 - config_file: this is used to specify the strategy [config](../docs/config-files) file (`--config` or `-c`)
 - show_plot: this flag tells AutoTrader to plot the results of the backtest onto an interactive chart (`--plot` or `-p`)
 - verbosity: this flag sets the verbosity of the code - a value of 1 requests moderate verbosity (`--verbosity` or `-v`)


### Using a Run File
To set properties above in a run file, you can copy the code below. First, we import AutoTrader from the autotrader package.
Next, we instantiate AutoTrader with `at = AutoTrader()`. This allows us to set the properties of the AutoTrader instance, 
`at`, as shown. Finally, we run AutoTrader with the command `at.run()`.

```python
from autotrader.autotrader import AutoTrader

at = AutoTrader()
at.backtest = True
at.verbosity = 1
at.show_plot = True
at.config_file = 'ema_cross'

at.run()
```

### On the Command Line
To run AutoTrader from the command line is simple. Just specify the properties as input flags and hit enter! 

```bash
$ ./AutoTrader -c 'ema_cross' -b -p -v 1
```

In this command, the flag `-b` sets AutoTrader to run in backtest mode, `-p` tells AutoTrader you would like to plot the results,
and `-v 1` sets the verbosity to `1`. Of course, you must still provide the strategy configuration file, done via `-c 'ema_cross'`.


## Backtest Results
With a verbosity of 1, you will see an output similar to that shown below. As you can see, there is a detailed breakdown of 
trades taken during the backtest period. Since we told AutoTrader to plot the results, you will also see the interactive chart
shown [below](#interactive-chart).
