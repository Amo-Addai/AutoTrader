title: Backtesting in AutoTrader
permalink: tutorials/backtesting
---

Now that you have [defined a strategy](strategy) and written the [configuration files](../docs/configuration), you can
have some fun with backtesting. 


## Running the Backtest
To run AutoTrader in [backtest mode](../docs/autotrader#backtest-mode), set `AutoTrader.backtest` to `True`. How you do 
this will depend on if you are running AutoTrader from a run file or from the command line. Other useful properties to set
include:
 - config_file: this flag (-c) is used to specify the strategy [config](../docs/config-files) file
 - show_plot: this flag (-p) tells AutoTrader to plot the results of the backtest onto an interactive chart
 - verbosity: this flag (-v) sets the verbosity of the code - a value of 1 requests moderate verbosity.

With a verbosity of 1, you will see an output similar to that shown below. As you can see, there is a detailed breakdown of traders taken during 
the backtest period. 


### Using a Run File

```python
from autotrader.autotrader import AutoTrader

at = AutoTrader()
at.backtest = True
at.verbosity = 1
at.show_plot = True
at.config_file = 'ema_cross'

at.run()
```

### On the Command Line
The command to do this is:

```bash
$ ./AutoTrader -c macd -b -p -v 1
```

Consider you want to develop and test a strategy using Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD), a popular trend-following momentum indicator. 
In your strategy, you go long (buy) when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, and go short when the oppposite happens. After doing some
research, you discover that MACD signals are strongest when cross-ups occur below the histogram-zero line (for long entries), or when cross-downs 
occur above the histogram-zero line. Furthermore, you follow the adage that 'the trend is your friend', so only go long when price is above the 
200 exponential moving average, and short when price is below it.

Coding this up in AutoTrader is easy; all you need is a [strategy](../docs/strategies) file and a [config](../docs/config-files) file. Then, with a
one line command, you can backtest your strategy over any time period and any time frame.

Looks pretty good right? Well good news! Going from backtesting to live-trading is as easy as removing 
the '-b' flag from the command above. But beware, backtesting performance alone is no strong indication of 
future performance! That's why [backtest validation](validation) is so important.

If you get an error message about your strategy not importing because it is in an 'unknown location', restart the console
and make sure you are in the correct working directory, as accoring to ... (where it shows the dir layout)
