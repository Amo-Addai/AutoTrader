title: Optimising a Strategy with AutoTrader
permalink: tutorials/optimisation
key: tut-optimisation

If you have successfully [set up a strategy](strategy) and run a [backtest](backtesting) on it, then you optimise
the strategy paramaters with ease. All you need to do extra is specify which parameters to optimise and what bounds 
should be placed on them and that's it! See the snippet of code below.

```python
from autotrader.auto_optimise import Optimise

# Optimise strategy parameters
opt                 = Optimise()
opt.config_file     = 'stock_ema_crossover'
opt.opt_params      = ['slow_ema', 'fast_ema']
opt.bounds          = [(5, 30), (10, 50)]

opt.optimise()
```

A couple of things to note: 
- optimisation is handled through `Optimise`, a class of the module `auto_optimise`, and so must first be imported.
- we instantiate Optimise in a similar manner to how we instantiate AutoTrader
- we specifiy the [strategy configuration](../docs/configuration-strategy) file, which provides our baseline parameters
- we specify that we would like to optimise the parameters 'slow_ema' and 'fast_ema', the periods of each moving average
  used in our strategy, as they appear in our strategy configuration file
- we specify the bounds on the slow and fast EMA periods as a tuple of the form (lower, upper) for each parameter being
  optimised
- finally, we run the optimisation by calling the `optimise()` method. 

By default, the optimiser will optimise the strategy with an objective of maximising the total profit, whilst minimising
the maximum drawdown. See the docs on AutoOptimise [here](../docs/optimisation) for more information.


## Output
Running the commands above will result in the following output. After only 34 seconds, you have an optimised strategy!
As you can see from the output, the optimal parameter values for the strategy configuration parameters specified are
approximately 26 and 20. This means that our slow EMA should have a period of 26, and our fast EMA should have a period
of 20.

## Comparison to Baseline Strategy
Now let's compare the performance of the strategy before and after optimisation. Simply run the backtest again with 
the optimised parameters (you will need to update the strategy configuration file) and observe the results shown below.

Let's take a look at the profit [before](backtesting) and after:
>
>Profit before optimisation:
>$428.205 (42.8%)
>
>Profit after optimisation:
>$683.444 (68.3%)

For a strategy with only two indicators, that is quite a large improvement!
