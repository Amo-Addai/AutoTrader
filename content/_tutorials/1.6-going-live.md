title: Going Live with AutoTrader
permalink: tutorials/live-trading

Live trading is the [default mode](../docs/autotrader) of operation in AutoTrader. As such, you only need to
specify the strategy configuration file. Of course, it is useful to provide additional inputs to AutoTrader,
such as the `notify` flag, to ensure that your strategy is running as intended.


## Getting Ready for Deployment

### Global Configuration
Specify all required account information.


### Strategy Configuration
Specify the correct trading environment, data feed, and (optionally) the trading sub-account to use.


## Automated Running
When you run AutoTrader in live-trade mode, it will analyse the current market conditions according to your
strategy and either do nothing, or submit an order to your broker. As such, you need a way to automatically run
AutoTrader at whatever interval your strategy demands. In theory, if you are running a strategy on the daily 
timeframe, you could manually run AutoTrader at a certain time each day. However, this will become tedious, 
especially when running a strategy on lower timeframes. To solve this, you will need a job scheduler.

```
crontab -e
```
