## From a Run File

## From the Command Line
If you are running AutoTrader from the command line, you can get help on any of the options by using the --help (-h) flag. For example,
for help on the flag '--notify', or '-n' for short, you can type `$ ./AutoTrader -h n`, which will produce the following output:


```
    _   _   _ _____ ___ _____ ____      _    ____  _____ ____  
   / \ | | | |_   _/ _ \_   _|  _ \    / \  |  _ \| ____|  _ \ 
  / _ \| | | | | || | | || | | |_) |  / _ \ | | | |  _| | |_) |
 / ___ \ |_| | | || |_| || | |  _ <  / ___ \| |_| | |___|  _ < 
/_/   \_\___/  |_| \___/ |_| |_| \_\/_/   \_\____/|_____|_| \_\
                                                               

Help for '--notify' (-n) option:
-----------------------------------
The notify option may be used to enable email notifications
of livetrade activity and AutoScan results.
Options:
  -n 0: No emails will be sent.
  -n 1: Minimal emails will be sent (summaries only).
  -n 2: All emails will be sent (every order and summary).
Note: if daily email summaries are desired, email_manager must
be employed in another scheduled job to send the summary.

Default value: 0

Example usage:
./AutoTrader.py -c my_config_file -n 1

For general help, use -h general.
```
