Currently AutoTrader has full integration of Oanda's [v20 REST API](https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/). 
This means that if you wish to use AutoTrader for live trading, you must make an account with Oanda and will be limited 
to the markets provided. 

Support for more brokers is coming soon, including for Interactive Brokers and Binance. In the meantime, you can still use
AutoTrader to develop, test and optimise strategies for any market by using the Yahoo Finance data feed. 


# Oanda v20 REST API
This API supports:
- Foreign Exchange Currencies
- Indices
- Bitcoin
- Commodities
- Bonds
- Metals

To link your Oanda v20 account to AutoTrader, see the global configuration [docs](docs/configuration-global).
