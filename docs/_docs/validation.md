# Validation of Backtesting Algorithm

To ensure that the backtest framework is correctly modelling market dynamics, a validation study was performed. This 
study consisted of two phases: 
  1) Data collection: AutoTrader was run in live-trade mode for one month to build a real trade history dataset
  2) Backtest validation: AutoTrader was run in backtest mode over the live-trade period to see how the predicted performance 
     of the backtest algorithm.

Performing such a study is made easy with [AutoPlot](docs/autoplot).
