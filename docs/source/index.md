# Welcome to AutoTrader's Documentation

AutoTrader is an event-driven platform designed to help in the development, optimisation and live 
deployment of automated trading systems. Here you will find everything you need to start 
algotrading with AutoTrader.

A basic level of experience with Python is recommended, but the documentation here 
aims to be clear enough that a beginner is able to pick up the key components as they go. If you are 
new to Python, you may find the tutorials especially useful. There is even a 
[complete walkthrough](tutorials/walkthrough), where a popular MACD trading strategy is built and tested.

If you are still deciding if AutoTrader is for you, check out the [features](features-landing) to 
see what is on offer. Otherwise, head on over to the [Getting Started](getting-started) guide.
