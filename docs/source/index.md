# Welcome to AutoTrader's Documentation

AutoTrader is an event-driven platform designed to help in the development, optimisation and live 
deployment of automated trading systems. Here you will find everything you need to start 
algotrading with AutoTrader.

A basic level of experience with Python is recommended for using AutoTrader, but the documentation 
aims to be clear enough that a beginner is able to pick up the key elements as they go. If you are 
new to Python, you may find the tutorials especially useful.

If you are still deciding if AutoTrader is for you, check out the [features](features-landing) to 
see what is on offer. Otherwise, head on over to the [Getting Started](getting-started) guide.
